BoC needs some documentation, but contains lots of usefull stuff like
* EventAggregator pattern implementation
* Inversion of Control wrapper (although being an anti-pattern, still very usefull. see other BoC packages like BoC.InversionOfControl.Unity for implementations)
* UnitOfWork pattern implementation (see other BoC packages like BoC.Persistence.NHibernate for implementations)
* Bootstrapper and Background task pattern implementation
* Logging wrapper (see BoC.Logging.log4net for implementation)
* Persistence repository and service pattern implementation (see other BoC packages like BoC.Persistence.NHibernate for implementations)
